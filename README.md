# CO2 Emissions Prediction

INTRODUCTION:

Carbon emissions and environmental protection issues have brought pressure from the International community during chinese economic development. Recently, the Chinese Govt. announced that carbon  emissions per unit of GDP would fall by 60-65%  compared with 2005 and non-fossil fuel energy would  account for 20% of primary energy consumption by  2030.
Hence, forecasting energy consumption is significant  to emissions reduction and upgrading energy supply  in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. This study  thoroughly analyzes carbon emissions' main energy  sources, including coal, petrol, natural gas, and coal  power in this region.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

"A Machine Learning model for calculating  CO2 Emissions by country"

Due to the increasingly deteriorating environment,  it is time for the government to upgrade the  Energy Consumption structure by making use of  Machine Learning prediction to analyze and  control the CO2 emissions in future
